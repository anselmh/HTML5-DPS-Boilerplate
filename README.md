HTML5-DPS-Boilerplate
=====================

This is a HTML5-Boilerplate to use within Adobe Digital Publishing-Suite or other Frameworks.

This boilerplate consists of a few files with minimal markup for best and easy use as "micro html" interactions in a digital publishing framework like the Adobe Digital Publishing Suite. It works on every modern tablet-device with all services that support the HTML-view.


Contents
--------

This "no-framework" consits of a little set of files with minimal markup ready for you to make any interactions with HTML, CSS and jQuery. We wanted to keep everything plain and simple, so you should work with minimal files and structure:

	index.html
the html file for you to work in. Reference this file in your digital publishing framework.
This file containts a section for CSS where we put a normalize/reset part and a section where you can put your jQuery into.

	js/jquery-1.7.2.min
	js/modernizr-2.5.3.min
we included jQuery 1.7.2 and modernizr 2.5.3 into this boilerplate. Use [Modernizr](http://modernizr.com) to test the features of the browser the file might be viewed on (iOS, Android). See [this commit](https://github.com/anselmh/HTML5-DPS-Boilerplate/commit/71f206958b8a56142e4ddb27885fc80241533311) what features-tests are included in the customized Modernizr build.
